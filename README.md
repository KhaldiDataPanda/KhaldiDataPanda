### Welcome to my GitHub! 🚀 <i>Code. Learn. Build. Repeat.</i>

I'm Abderrahmane — a tech enthusiast who lives somewhere between code and creativity. I spend most of my time tinkering with AI models, building cool data-driven tools, and exploring how technology can make sense of messy real-world problems.

I'm not just into making models work — I care about *why* they work, how they fail, and how we can make them better. I enjoy diving deep into data science, AI engineering, and software systems that push ideas from research into real, usable things.


## ⚙️ What I Do

- **Machine Learning & AI Engineering**: From small ML models to large neural networks — if it learns from data, I’ve probably played with it.
- **Data Science**: Crafting data pipelines, exploring patterns, and telling stories through numbers.
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Turning notebooks into living, breathing apps using FastAPI, Streamlit, and containerized workflows.
- **Problem Solving**: I like challenging problems — from NLP in Arabic dialects to computer vision for real-world tasks.


## 🔭 What I’m Building

- Automated report generation systems for medical imaging 🩻
- Emotion-aware recommendation systems combining voice, text & vision 🎭
- Fake news detection models and NLP pipelines for Arabic content 🌍
- Interactive dashboards and data apps for real-time insights 📊


## 🌱 Always Exploring

Every week I try to learn something new — a model, a tool, or even a random math concept that helps me think differently. I believe the best kind of progress is the one that keeps curiosity alive.


## 🤝 Let's Connect

If you’re into data, AI, or building useful tech with real impact, I’d love to chat or collaborate.
